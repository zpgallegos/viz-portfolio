# Visualization Portfolio

Projects designed to demonstrate some visualization chops, for funsies and for job-searching and such.

* [Election 2016 Voting Map](http://election-2016-map.zgallegos.com/) (hosted via AWS S3)
    * Voting maps created via about a billion lines of [d3.js](https://d3js.org/). I originally created this as an article for a visualization-based blog I used to write.
    * Please admire the physics-based animated plots towards the bottom so I didn't throw up repeatedly writing that code for no reason ðŸ˜–
    * [Code](https://github.com/zpgallegos/zgallegos/tree/master/election-2016-map)
* [Titanic Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zachary.gallegos/viz/Titanic_16621772644820/Dashboard?publish=yes)
    * A Tableau dashboard for every data scientists' favorite "Who survived the Titanic?" dataset on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview">Kaggle</a>
